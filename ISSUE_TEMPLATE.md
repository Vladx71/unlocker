Hi,

Since there is no issue tracker for your repo, I can't find any other way to contact you :)

I've tried to use patcher for VMWare 12.5.9, but it kills my install due to some driver version mismatch. Is there any chance to fix it soon?

Error message 
Version mismatch with vmmon driver: expecting 308.0, got 309.0.

Thanks a lot
Vlad
